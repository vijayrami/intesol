About Patch Files:

Patch files were developed to provide compatibility with older versions of Magento.

IMPORTANT
---------
Check your Magento version in the Admin panel (located at the footer of all pages) and ONLY apply the Patch folder that correspond to your version. 

If you can’t find a Patch folder that match your version then your Magento version doesn’t require a patch (just copy the content inside “Theme” folder)

Note: Last version of Magento will never require you to apply a Patch folder.
